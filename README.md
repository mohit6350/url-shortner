# Limitations:
While Chotu URL strives to provide a convenient and efficient URL shortening experience, users should be aware of certain limitations associated with the current version of the project.

# Experimental Nature:
Chotu URL is an experimental project, and as such, users are encouraged to approach it with a level of caution. The experimental nature implies ongoing development, potential feature adjustments, and occasional downtimes for maintenance or updates. Users should be prepared for occasional changes as the project evolves.

# Usage Quota:
Chotu URL relies on the TinyURL service for URL shortening, which imposes a usage limit of 600 requests per month. This limitation is essential to note, especially for users with high-frequency URL shortening needs. Exceeding this limit may temporarily restrict the URL shortening feature until the usage quota resets.

# Limited Customization:
While Chotu URL allows users to add descriptive tags to their shortened URLs, the customization options are currently limited. Users cannot, for instance, create custom aliases for their links. Future updates may introduce more extensive customization features, but users should be aware of the current constraints.

# Security Considerations:
Chotu URL employs encryption to secure user passwords; however, the experimental nature of the project means that continuous security evaluations are part of the development process. Users are advised to use unique and strong passwords, and sensitive information should be shared cautiously, recognizing that security features are subject to updates and improvements.

# Dependency on External Service:
Chotu URL relies on the TinyURL service for URL shortening functionality. While this ensures reliable and widely accepted shortened links, users should be mindful of the dependency on an external service. Changes or interruptions in the TinyURL service may impact the functionality of Chotu URL.

# Platform Compatibility:
Chotu URL is optimized for web browsers and may have varying levels of compatibility with different devices and browsers. Users are encouraged to use modern web browsers for the best experience. Support for additional platforms and browsers may be addressed in future updates.

# Lack of Offline Functionality:
Chotu URL requires an internet connection to function. The absence of offline functionality means that users won't be able to access or generate shortened URLs when offline. Consideration for offline capabilities is a potential avenue for future development.
